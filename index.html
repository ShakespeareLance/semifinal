              <p class="timeline-text">Most probably some of the people might already know me for being a mayabang ,arrogant, jolly person. Because those are the few things that I heard people say about me when I first entered this University but what exactly happened that brought me to that point?
                Hi, my name is Lance Shakespeare Barrios Limbanganon. Believe it or not, my story didn't start off that way. the summer before first sem began i felt like i was at the peak of my life everything was going on my way, but deep inside i didn't like the person i was becoming i was insensitive, know it all , i was full of myself that's why deep inside i knew that it was only a matter of time before everything falls apart. and sooner or later it did. but at the same time ,at that moment in my life i felt like i was an outcast nobody wanted to associate with me it even came to that point that i just told myself "sige nalang" "malamposan ra gihapon nako ni" but the hardest pill for me to swallow was the fact. na when you’re at your lowest u cannot do it alone. Because when you're up here, it feels great, it feels like u can do anything, but when your down there badly kaylangan jud nimo naay mo alalay sa imo pataas pero swerte ko kay , some of the students in COMSCIE department gave me a chance and slowly but surely, i was able to show people who i really was because those few people didn't only accept me they also inspired me to become the person i always want to be, a friend , a achiever but most importantly an inspiration my self kay kung ako nahimo to malabyan too pud ko na kaya pud ninyo to malamposan.
                I want my story to serve as a testimony and a inspiration to all of the students in our department that even though we're not invincible and even though most  of us did a lot of mistake in the past and even if everybody saw us fail and get down on our knees 
                We can still get back up and SUCCEED. once again my name is LANCE LIMBANGANON</p>

          <h3 class="h3 service-title">I- Summary</h3>
          <p>
            Irrigation assumes critical stature in agricultural production and plays a vital role in securing food production and sustainable livelihoods. However, older, sicker, and degraded irrigation systems are one of the major challenges, mainly in Asia, which affect agricultural sustainability. Sustainability in agricultural practices is very necessary for the long-term viability of the agricultural sector. The methodology adopted for the research in the present study was to go into the depth of the challenges pertaining to blocked irrigation and the identification of ways to revitalize agricultural practices. It includes a literature review, collection of data on the current status of irrigation systems, analysis of case studies on successful revitalization efforts, and interviews with farmers, irrigation officials, researchers, and policymakers.

          <h3 class="h3 service-title">II- Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            In many nations across the globe, a lot of people depend on agriculture since it is a major source of their food and they receive income from it. Yet, this sector has always encountered huge hurdles in its quest to enhance efficiency while minimizing environmental degradation. One method employed by farmers to achieve these objectives is watering their crops; this helps to promote their growth and at the same time provides assurance of availability throughout the year.. However, the condition of irrigation systems in most parts of the world is increasingly worrisome. Aging infrastructures, inefficient use of water, and environmental degradations are but some of the problems that inflict irrigation systems and threaten the sustainability of agricultural production in the long term. It is in this context that new approaches and practices need to be explored in order to enhance agricultural sustainability while ensuring food security. Among these are climate-smart agriculture, organic farming, biodynamic agriculture, sustainable intensification, and regenerative agriculture. In addition, the use of best agriculture practices, such as soil fertility management and application of well-decomposed farmyard manure, compost manure, cattle urine, and wood ash, will significantly enhance the crop yields, reduce agrochemicals, and increase soil organic matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            This paper will look into the problems being faced in irrigation systems and see how agricultural practices could be revitalized toward sustainability. This paper will try to contribute toward ongoing discourses on sustainable agriculture and irrigation management through fixing the problems of the present state of irrigation systems, identifying barriers to sustainable agriculture, and discussing new approaches and practices.

          <p>
            1. Research the irrigation systems in Banacud, Bitoon Hinatuan SDS, the problems associated with irrigation if it is to be made more effective and sustainable. The consequences of obstructed irrigation on agricultural production, food security as well as the environment need to be understood. Also, show the economic, social and environmental losses that result from ineffective irrigation systems.<br>2. What are the consequences of restricted irrigation channels on agricultural output, starvation levels, environment, stressing the monetary, cultural, and environment costs of ineffective channels.<br>3.Find new methods and techniques that improve agricultural sustainability, like climate-smart agriculture, organic farming, biodynamic agriculture, sustainable intensification, and regenerative agriculture.<br>4.Focus on soil fertility management and the use of natural amendments to investigate the role played by good agriculture practices in improving crop yields as well as in reducing agrochemicals use while also increasing soil organic matter.<br>5. Come up with a framework for the rejuvenation of irrigation systems including new technology, policies and practices that can improve irrigation management efficiency, equity and sustainability.<br>6. Farmers and policymakers, as well as private sector stakeholders are among the key stakeholders including researchers in promoting sustainable irrigation practices.<br>7. It is recommended that policy and institutional reforms should be advised that they would help in adopting sustainable irrigation practices which include incentives, rules as well as capacity building initiatives.<br>8. Come up with a plan that explains how to move from traditional to sustainable irrigation systems by increasing scalable agriculture systems. Provide details on the finances, partnerships, time schedules which need to be considered.

          <p>
           • It is essential that we provide instruction on how to fix and repair civilian power supplies so that they can be efficiently used in order to meet the needs of farmers who depend on it.<br>• It is therefore our duty as farmers to show other people how easy it is to switch over to organic farming.<br>• Achieving food security depends on getting rid of barriers holding back farming like dry land farming so that rainwater can be better used instead of running off so quickly.<br>• To enhance the abilities of farmers, agricultural extension officers and local communities in sustainable agriculture and water resource management initiatives.  <br>• To bring government departments together and work in partnership with civil society organizations and private sector actors to enable the successful implementation and scale-up of sustainable agriculture interventions."

            <br>
          <h3 class="h3 service-title">V-Timeline or Schedule</h3>
          <p>1. The first two months should be spent doing a full evaluation on the extent of the irrigation facilities that are already in place so that we can have a clear understanding of what works and what does not.<br>2. Between month three and six, on the other hand, try out some rehabilitation or restoration work such as removing silt from canals. Research more on how this sentence combo can be enhanced.<br>3. Teach peasant farmers about sustainable farming practices, water-saving technologies as well as soil conservation mechanisms during months 7-9.<br>4. Establish practical experiments and farmer education on farming in 10-12 months to reveal best practices used in sustainable agriculture. Let learning through practice increase in length.<br>5. Month 13-15: Support the establishment of community based irrigation water using organizations that manage water for productive use in a manner that will promote sustainability.<br>6. Between months sixteen and eighteen, you should put up campaigns as well as educational workshops which serve to sensitize the public about the need for conserving water; look after agricultural land that is same for fertility values, and biological diversity.<br>7.Months 19-21: The strategy should be promoting accessibility of farm inputs e.g. drought resistant seeds, organic fertilizers as well as environmentally friendly pest control methods. <br>8. Months 22-24: Keep tabs on project undertakings and assess if they achieve their set goals. Tasks involved include figuring out how close such missions are to reaching fruition, analyzing results, and summarizing ideas which might benefit other related works of similar nature.</p>

          <p>After watching the video titled "Strong Climate Action for a More Resilient, Sustainable, and Prosperous Philippines," I have both hope and determination. I see a future in fifteen years in which our present actions result in a healthier and livelier planet.</p>
          <p>In fifteen years, I see a Philippines where sustainable practices are deeply rooted in our everyday routine. An example of this could involve relying heavily on the natural energy outflow from the sun as well as utilizing it from the wind; also water via dams for purposes like turning turbines in order to generate electricity instead of depending too much on oil based power generation systems specifically those relying on coal or petroleum based fuels. If we take this direction then we will be able to reduce our emissions by a lot thereby helping the world combat climate change through a massive drop of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>
          <p>I dream that life-filled forests can be re-established and shielded by strong reforestation schemes. These forests will not just operate as carbon stores but also serve as havens for various fauna species hence ensuring the protection of our plentiful biodiversity. It’s likely to see a beautiful underwater world with clean rivers’ waters, neat lakes’ banks, and seas where no garbage litters around as they don’t pollute fish or other organisms vital for both people and wildlife.</p>
          <p>In the future, we will transform urban spaces by incorporating gardens, good transport systems, and eco-focused architectural designs. We will use green building materials and smart city technologies that are gentle on nature but lead to an improved standard of living among city dwellers. Similarly, farming techniques will be environmentally-friendly emphasizing organic agriculture and creative methods of guaranteeing enough food without causing harm to the soil.</p>
          <p>The revolution will largely rely on education and enlightening efforts. Hopefully, within the next 15 years, environmentally conscious education will be assimilated into our syllabus thereby nurturing the future generation’s consciousness of duty towards the environment. Communities will have the capacity to act, buoyed by favorable legislations that encourage conservation of environment and adaptation to climatic changes. </p>
          <p>When I look to the future, my hope is that the world community will by then have acquired the culture of adoring the environment and ensuring its safety. This means that every person will be sensitized on how their actions have an influence on nature, therefore, ought to pick choices that conserve it. The result of all our combined input will be a strong nation in terms both social/economic terms, which makes greater use of things which cannot be used up while living together with other creatures amicably.</p>
          <p>We express gratitude to you, Mother Earth, for all the gorgeousness we receive from you and the many useful things. It is our promise to take care and defend you; as such we want you to continue bearing fruits just like you do now. With regard and obligation,</p>

            In 15 years, I am optimistic about witnessing a globe that has made bold moves in reversing climate alteration. We would have embraced renewable energy further reducing pollution hence rejuvenating our natural habitats. Woods will thrive; seas will be uncontaminated while animals flourish.
          </p>
          <p>In our society, everyone would be inspired to consider their ecological footprint through environmental education. By so doing, current actions shall define the kind of destiny that awaits us. On this account I am grateful for your generosity. Furthermore, you can always count on our support. Yours sincerely,</p>

            Dear Mother Earth, In the next fifteen years, I would love a Philippines where sustainable livelihood patterns are the commonly accepted practice. Urban settings shall turn green and consume less power ; trees are replanted in all forests while lakes continue to have clean waters ; the alternative energy sources and agricultural methods are being adopted by all to reduce the rate at which we emit carbon into air.
          </p>
          <p>People of all ages will be actively involved in conservation efforts and consequently, it is anticipated that environmental awareness will be common. We commit ourselves to protect you Mother Earth for all your support.</p>

          <br><p>
            In a decade and a half, I anticipate a day when tough climates are not a reality anymore. In my mind’s eye, I see green jungles and pretty beaches, where we get our energy from windmills and plants alone. By then, all the responsibilities we ignored will have been taken care of thus improving our health through less dirtiness and protection for various species, including those which we value most like elephants- whose existence is threatened by poaching due to demand mostly coming from Asian countries; by taking measures towards more sustainability than destroying everything without being considerate.
          </p>
          <p>We thank you for your beauty and resources. It is guaranteed that we shall protect you for the sake of our grandchildren. Regards,</p>
